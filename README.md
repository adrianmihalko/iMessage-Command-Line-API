# iMessage-Command-Line-API

##What is Remote Messages?

Remote Messages is a browser based front-end for the iOS Messages application.
Our goal is to replicate as much functionality from the native Messages app as we can in the web browser.

##What is this project?

You will be able to send iMessage trough Remote Messages app from PHP. I am planning to send status messages from my Domoticz server.

##What you need to send iMessages from Linux, Windows, Mac OS X from CLI or from your projects?

1. an  iPhone with installed Remote Messages app.
2. write your own code based on mine
